# CarND-Path-Planning-Project
A C++ implementation of a path planner that is able to safely navigate a vehicle around a virtual highway with other traffic.

### Simulator.
You can download the Term3 Simulator which contains the Path Planning Project from the [releases tab](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases/tag/T3_v1.2).  

To run the simulator on Mac/Linux, first make the binary file executable with the following command:
```shell
sudo chmod u+x {simulator_file_name}
```

### Goals and Implementation
The goal of this project was to safely navigate a simulated vehicle around a virtual highway with other traffic that is driving +-10 MPH of the 50 MPH speed limit. For this task, the car uses the provided localization and sensor fusion data in combination with a sparse map list of waypoints around the highway. The car is supposed to go as close as possible to the 50 MPH speed limit, which means passing slower traffic when possible, while other cars will try to change lanes too. The car should avoid hitting other cars at all cost as well as driving inside of the marked road lanes at all times, unless going from one lane to another. The car should be able to make one complete loop around the 6946m highway. Since the car is trying to go 50 MPH, it should take a little over 5 minutes to complete 1 loop. Also the car should not experience total acceleration over 10 m/s^2 and jerk that is greater than 10 m/s^3.

The path planning used in my implementation is based on a simple principle: 
* Try to follow the provided waypoints by interpolating between the car's current position and the next waypoints. The interpolation is based on splines, using this library: http://kluge.in-chemnitz.de/opensource/spline/ (The spline function is in a single header file, making it really easy to use.)
* If there is a (slower) car in front, try to change lanes
  * Detect free lanes and move to one of these lanes by shifting the next waypoints for the spline to the free lane.
  * If all lanes are occupied, match the speed of the car in front and wait for a lane changing opportunity.
Using this algorithm, the car is able to quickly and successfully complete an entire lap around the virtual highway.

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./path_planning`.

After that, run the term 3 simulator. Your car should now start driving along the highway! 

## Information about the provided data (map, simulator)

#### Map of the highway (data/highway_map.txt)
Each waypoint in the list contains  [x,y,s,dx,dy] values. x and y are the waypoint's map coordinate position, the s value is the distance along the road to get to that waypoint in meters, the dx and dy values define the unit normal vector pointing outward of the highway loop.

The highway's waypoints loop around so the frenet s value, distance along the road, goes from 0 to 6945.554.

Here is the data provided from the Simulator to the C++ Program:

#### Main car's localization Data (No Noise)

["x"] The car's x position in map coordinates

["y"] The car's y position in map coordinates

["s"] The car's s position in frenet coordinates

["d"] The car's d position in frenet coordinates

["yaw"] The car's yaw angle in the map

["speed"] The car's speed in MPH

#### Previous path data given to the Planner

["previous_path_x"] The previous list of x points previously given to the simulator

["previous_path_y"] The previous list of y points previously given to the simulator

#### Previous path's end s and d values 

["end_path_s"] The previous list's last point's frenet s value

["end_path_d"] The previous list's last point's frenet d value

#### Sensor Fusion Data, a list of all other car's attributes on the same side of the road. (No Noise)

["sensor_fusion"] A 2d vector of cars and then that car's [car's unique ID, car's x position in map coordinates, car's y position in map coordinates, car's x velocity in m/s, car's y velocity in m/s, car's s position in frenet coordinates, car's d position in frenet coordinates. 

## Working with the simulator

1. The car uses a perfect controller and will visit every (x,y) point it recieves in the list every .02 seconds. The units for the (x,y) points are in meters and the spacing of the points determines the speed of the car. The vector going from a point to the next point in the list dictates the angle of the car. Acceleration both in the tangential and normal directions is measured along with the jerk, the rate of change of total Acceleration. The (x,y) point paths that the planner recieves should not have a total acceleration that goes over 10 m/s^2, also the jerk should not go over 50 m/s^3.

2. There will be some latency between the simulator running and the path planner returning a path, with optimized code usually its not very long (just 1-3 time steps). During this delay the simulator will continue using points that it was last given. Because of this, the last points we've used are stored so that a smooth transition is achieved.
